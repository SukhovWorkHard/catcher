# catcher
a simple game based on the principle of catching falling objects.

I am working on the project exclusively in my free time, so the development process can drag on for a long period of time. 
I do this purely for my own pleasure, so adequate criticism is welcome.

19.12.2024 => the next step will be adding navigation, the app will not be large so it will be something like splash--onboarding--menu (play, settings, exit), the rest will be planned a little later. I will also try to describe the whole process/ideas in this file.
